# mtrl-visual-interference
Experiment to assess visual interference in multi-task reinforcement learning due to visual dissimilarities across source tasks. Adapted from openai baselines. 

In addition to newly created files, stable_baselines_master/stable_baselines/deepq/dqn.py has been heavily modified to run the experiment concurrently across multiple threads.

(Code works. Will add instructions for usage soon.)
